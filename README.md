"Portfolio" 
Using CMS Webflow, the web page is created from scratch and hosted on a custom domain.
I implemented:
1) a zoom effect with scroll interactions;
2) a simple card flip animation CSS 3D transforms;
3) a three-dimensional rotating cube.

The web page was recreated duaring a workshop that I held for 50 participants at Oslo Science park. (Read more about the workshop: http://www.womenitech.com/blog-posts.html)
